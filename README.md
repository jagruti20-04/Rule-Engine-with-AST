### AST Rule Engine

## Overview 

The Rule Engine is a flexible and scalable application designed to create, evaluate, and combine rules for determining user eligibility based on various attributes. Built with Spring Boot, it provides a RESTful API that allows users to manage rules effectively.

## Features

# 1.Create Rules

Endpoint: /rules/create 

Method: POST 

Description: Users can create new rules by providing necessary attributes and conditions. 

Request Body: JSON object with rule details (e.g., name, conditions). Response: Confirmation message with the created rule ID.

# 2.Evaluate Rules 

Endpoint: /rules/evaluate 

Method: POST 

Description: This feature evaluates the provided rules against given user attributes to determine eligibility. 

Request Body: JSON object with user attributes to evaluate against the existing rules. 

Response: Indicates whether the user is eligible and lists matched rules.

# 3.Combine Rules 

Endpoint: /rules/combine 

Method: POST 

Description: Users can combine multiple rules to create complex conditions for evaluation. 

Request Body: JSON object with the rules to be combined and the logic for combination (e.g., AND, OR). 

Response: Confirmation message with the combined rule ID.

# 4.Additional Features

Dynamic Rule Management: Modify existing rules without downtime. 

Custom Logic Support: Implement complex logic using combinations of rules. 

Logging: Comprehensive logging for actions taken within the application, aiding in debugging and auditing.

Exception Handling: The application includes a robust exception handling mechanism to gracefully manage errors and provide meaningful messages to users. This ensures a smoother user experience and better debugging.
